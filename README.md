# 🧠 Writeups & Cyber Lab Notes
A unified repository of my cybersecurity writeups, lab notes, and challenge solutions across CTFs and training platforms:
- 🧪 Labs (TryHackMe, Hack The Box, BTLO, Infinity Learning)
- 🏁 CTF events & competitions
- 🎄 Advent Calendar CTFs
- 🛡️ Blue team detections / investigation notes (where applicable)

## 🎄 Current Focus: Advent Calendar CTFs
- 2025 Advent Index: `writeups/2025/advent/`

---

## 📁 Repository Map
- `writeups/` → event-based writeups (CTFs, competitions, seasonal events)
- `labs/` → platform-based writeups (THM/HTB/BTLO/etc.)
- `tools/` → helper scripts (scaffolding, parsing, automation)
- `templates/` → writeup templates
- `references/` → links, cheat-sheets, notes

---

## ✅ Writeup Format (standard)
Each challenge/day folder includes:
- `README.md` (the writeup)
- `files/` (provided artifacts; sanitized if needed)
- `solve/` (scripts / commands)
- `assets/` (screenshots)

## ⚠️ Notes
- No secrets, tokens, or sensitive/internal data will be committed.
- Some writeups may omit flags/solutions if required by platform rules.
